# Multilayer Perceptron
Project realised in a team of 3, where we explored multilayered perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through the analysis of the FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We implemented a MLP from scratch, and conducted multiple experiments using the FashionMNIST dataset in order to have a better understanding of the effects that the different hyperparameters can have on the model's performance. We then conducted more experiments using CNNs from the torch library on the CIFAR-10 dataset to study how it works.
